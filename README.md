The 2x version 4 scripts are for 

1. Converting an empty/new Comfy Portable install to one with Triton 2 and Sage 2 within it to make videos as quickly as possible
2. Making a brand new cloned version of Comfy, making a venv within and install Triton 2 and Sage 2

   As the scripts are run, checks are made (done my best to idiot proof them)
   As they progress, they will give you choices - Python to install, Pytorch stable or Nightly, Triton version, Sage Attention version.
   As each part installs, it will delete the folder it used to give a clean install.
   At the end of each script, it will make bat files to run and update the install
