The 2 Comfy Autoinstall files are for making automatically downloading/installing a fresh version of Comfy (clone) and making a venv for it, installing its requirements and finally installing Triton and Sageattention .


The 2 v4 files are for making Nightly installs to allow the use of FP16Fast - one for making a new cloned Comfy and the other to install a new Torch into an empty portable Comfy. 16.03.25
